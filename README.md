Lots of the good stuff will end up in [closed issues](https://github.com/STAT540-UBC/Discussion/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed), so dont' forget to look there! Or, more generally, use the "Search" feature on this repository to find things. It is quite likely that you find the answer to your problem in last years issues!
